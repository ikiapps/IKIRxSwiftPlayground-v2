# IKIRxSwiftPlayground-v2

This project consists of a minimal workspace with a playground for testing iOS code with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).
Of course, you can also add other frameworks easily through Carthage.
Tested with Xcode 9, Swift 4 and RxSwift 4.

It has

* No code signing
* No property list
* There's not even an app here

It's just a _workspace_ that uses RxSwift installed by Carthage.

Install RxSwift using

    $ carthage update --platform ios

Open `IKIRxSwiftPlayground-v2.xcworkspace`.

Play, learn, test. Happy prototyping!
